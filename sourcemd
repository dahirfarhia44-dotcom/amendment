Amendment
a better Garissa a better tomorrow
Amendments means action. It signifies a necessary change from the status quo to a better, more functional future. In Garissa, highlighting problems is not enough; we must identify specific areas—from water governance and waste management to youth employment—that demand immediate and targeted reform. This platform exists to bridge the gap between awareness and accountability, driving community-led solutions and inspiring leadership to implement permanent, positive amendments that ensure a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous Garissa for every resident.
