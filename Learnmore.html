            <h1>Youth unemployment</h1>
            <p>Youth unemployment in Garissa remains high due to limited job opportunities, low skills training, and dependence on a small public sector. To address this, the county can expand vocational training, support youth-led businesses, create recycling and waste-management jobs, partner with the private sector, and improve access to loans or grants for startups. Encouraging digital skills, agribusiness, and local manufacturing can also open more sustainable employment opportunities for young people.</p>

            <h1>Waste management</h1>
            <p>Garissa can improve waste management by increasing regular garbage collection, setting up designated waste points, and educating communities on proper disposal. The county should support recycling through youth groups and small sorting centers, promote composting of organic waste, and upgrade dumpsites into controlled landfills. Strong enforcement of anti-dumping laws, partnerships with schools and NGOs, and simple technology like reporting hotlines will also make the system more effective and sustainable.</p>

            <h1>Poor health services</h1>
            <p>Poor health services in Garissa are caused by understaffed hospitals, limited medical supplies, long distances to health facilities, and inadequate funding. To improve this, the county should invest in more health workers, upgrade equipment, ensure consistent supply of medicines, strengthen community health programs, and improve transport and emergency services. Partnerships with NGOs and national government can also enhance accessibility and quality of healthcare for residents.</p>

            <h1>Drought & livelihood challenges</h1>
            <p>Drought in Garissa severely affects livelihoods by reducing water sources, killing livestock, destroying crops, and increasing food insecurity. Families lose income, are forced to migrate, and depend heavily on relief support. To address this, the county should invest in reliable water systems, promote drought-resistant farming, support livestock health programs, strengthen early-warning systems, and diversify income through small businesses and climate-resilient livelihoods.</p>
