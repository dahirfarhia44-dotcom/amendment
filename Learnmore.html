            <h1>Youth unemployment</h1>
            <p>Youth unemployment in Garissa remains high due to limited job opportunities, low skills training, and dependence on a small public sector. To address this, the county can expand vocational training, support youth-led businesses, create recycling and waste-management jobs, partner with the private sector, and improve access to loans or grants for startups. Encouraging digital skills, agribusiness, and local manufacturing can also open more sustainable employment opportunities for young people.</p>

            <h1>Waste management</h1>
            <p>Garissa can improve waste management by increasing regular garbage collection, setting up designated waste points, and educating communities on proper disposal. The county should support recycling through youth groups and small sorting centers, promote composting of organic waste, and upgrade dumpsites into controlled landfills. Strong enforcement of anti-dumping laws, partnerships with schools and NGOs, and simple technology like reporting hotlines will also make the system more effective and sustainable.</p>
