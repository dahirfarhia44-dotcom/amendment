            <h2>Key Issues in Garissa</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Scarcity:</strong> Limited access to clean and safe drinking water affects health and livelihoods. <em>Solution:</em> Implement community-based water management systems and invest in rainwater harvesting.</li>
                <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Inadequate waste disposal leads to environmental pollution. <em>Solution:</em> Establish organized waste collection services and promote recycling initiatives.</li>
                <li><strong>Youth Unemployment:</strong> High unemployment rates among youth contribute to social instability. <em>Solution:</em> Create vocational training programs and support local entrepreneurship.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthcare Access:</strong> Limited healthcare facilities hinder disease prevention and treatment. <em>Solution:</em> Expand healthcare infrastructure and mobile clinics to reach remote areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Education Quality:</strong> Insufficient educational resources affect learning outcomes. <em>Solution:</em> Invest in school infrastructure, teacher training, and provide learning materials.</li>
